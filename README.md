An exercise to build a JavaScript calculator from The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator)

This was modeled after the android calculator.

# Bugs/Items to implement
* Implement a way to display the total calculation after hitting 'equals'
* Make using the backspace more intuitive
* Add eventlisteners to use keyboard controls as well as mouse clicks
* Add ability to type in complex calculations, and receive correct answer following Order of Operations
* Add 'scientific mode', allowing users to do more complex calculations (I.E. powers)
